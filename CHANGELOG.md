### Requirements (1 change)
- #768 Removed temporary pin of Pillow to v6 which used to break torch and torchvision packages.

### Added (4 changes)
- [#100007](https://gitlab.com/secml/secml/-/issues/100007) Added new experimental package `ml.scalers` with a different implementation of `ml.features.normalization` classes directly based Scikit-Learn's scalers. Included classes are: `CScalerMinMax`, `CScalerStd`, `CScalerNorm`.

- #812 `CAttackPoisoning` now exposes: `x0`, `xc`, `yc`, `objective_function` and `objective_function_gradient`.
- #776 `n_jobs` is now a init parameter of `CModule` and subclasses and not passed via `fit` anymore.

### Improved (12 changes)
- #817 Added `CClassifierSVM` native support to OVA multiclass scheme, without replicating the kernel in each one-vs-all classifier.
- #574 Added `_clear_cache` mechanism to `CModule` and classes that require caching data in the forward pass before backward (e.g., exponential kernels do that to avoid re-computing the kernel matrix in the backward pass).
- #820 Add parallel execution of `forward` method for `CClassifierMulticlassOVA` and `CClassifierMulticlassOVO`.
- #815 Simplified `CAttack` interface (now only requires implementing `run` as required by `CSecEval`).
- #574 Modified kernel and classifier interfaces to allow their use as preprocessing modules.
- #775 Improved efficiency in gradient computation of SVMs, by back-propagating the alpha values to the kernel.
- #773 Improved efficiency in the computation of gradients of evasion attacks (`CAttackEvasionPGDLS`). Now gradient is called once rather than twice to compute the gradient of the objective function.
- #801 `CSecEval` will now check that the `param_name` input argument can be found in the attack class used in the evaluation.
- #695 `COptimizerPGD` now exits optimization if constraint radius is 0. `COptimizerPGD` , `COptimizerPGDLS` and `COptimizerPGDExp` will now raise a warning if the 0-radius constraint is defined outside the given bounds.

- #817 Removed `store_dual_vars` and `kernel.setter` from `CClassifierSVM`. Now a linear SVM is trained in the primal (w,b) if `kernel=None`, otherwise it is trained in the dual (alpha and b), on the precomputed training kernel matrix.
- #765 Unified `fit` interface from `fit(ds)` to `fit(x,y)` to be consistent across normalizers and classifiers.
- #574 Removed redundant definitions of `gradient(x, w)` from `CKernelRBF`, `CKernelLaplacian`, `CKernelEuclidean`, `CClassifierDNN`, `CNormalizerUnitNorm`. The protected property `grad_requires_forward` now specifies if gradient has to compute an explicit forward pass or only propagate the input `x` through the pre-processing chain before calling `backward`.
- #823 Removed `surrogate_data` parameter from `CAttackPoisoning` and renamed it to `double_init_ds` in `CAttackEvasion` subclasses.

### Fixed (10 changes)
- #816 Fixed stop condition of `COptimizerPGD` which was missing index `i`.
- #825 Infer the number of attacked classifier classes directly from it (instead of inferring it from surrogate data) in `CAttackEvasionPGDLS` to fix a crash when the class index of data points is greater or equal than the number of alternative data points.
- #810 Fixed `CClassifierPyTorch.backward` not working properly due to a miscalculation of the number of input features of the model when a `CNormalizeDNN` is used as preprocessor.
- #803 Fixed checks on the inner classifier in `CClassifierRejectThreshold` which can be bypassed by using the clf attribute setter, now removed.
- #818 Fixed `CCreator.set` not allowing to set writable attributes of level-0 readable-only attributes.
- #819 Fixed `CCreator.get_params` not returning level-0 not-writable attributes having one or more writable attributes.
- #785 Fixed constant override of matplotlib backend in `CFigure` on Windows systems.
- #783 Fixed `model_zoo.load_model` improperly building download urls depending on the system default url separator.
- #771 Fixed the following methods of `CSparse` to ensure they properly work independently from the sparse array format: `save`, `load`, `__pow__`, `round`, `nan_to_num`, `logical_and`, `unique`, `bincount`, `prod`, `all`, `any`, `min`, `max`.
- #769 `CArray.tocsr()` now always returns a `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` array as expected.

### Removed & Deprecated (2 changes)
- #540 Removed `discrete` and `surrogate_classifier` parameter from `CAttack`.

## v0.12 (11/03/2020)
- #726 Refactored kernel package (now `secml.ml.kernels`). Kernel classes are now inherited from `CModule`, which enables computing gradients more efficiently. This will enable us to use kernels as preprocessors in future releases.
- #755 Package `secml.ml.model_zoo` has been moved to `secml.model_zoo`.
- #721 Dictionary with model zoo definitions is now dynamically downloaded and updated from our repository located at https://gitlab.com/secml/secml-zoo. The package `model_zoo.models` containing python scripts defining models structure is now removed and the scripts will be downloaded from the same repository upon request.

### Added (7 changes)
- #660 `CClassifierPyTorch` now accepts as input a PyTorch learning rate scheduler via the `optimizer_scheduler` parameter.
- #678 Added new parameter `return_optimizer` to `CClassifierPyTorch.get_state` which allows getting the state of the classifier without including the state of the `optimizer` (and of the new `optimizer_scheduler`).

- Added the parameter `minlength` to the `bincount` method of `CArray`.
- Added new `CNormalizerTFIDF` which implements a term frequency–inverse document frequency features normalizer.

- #722 Added new optional parameter `headers` to `utils.download_utils.dl_file` function which allows specifying additional headers for the download request.

### Improved (8 changes)
- #664 The following `CClassifierPyTorch` parameters can now be modified after instancing the class: `optimizer`, `epochs`, `batch_size`. This will make some procedures easier, like fine-tuning a pre-trained network.
- #712 `download_utils.dl_file()` will now use the filename stored in response's headers if available. The previous behavior (get the last part of the download url) will be used as a fallback.
- #748 `CNormalizerUnitNorm` re-factored by adding gradient computation.
- #706 Rewrite `CKernelRBF` gradient when passing `w` to speed up computations by avoiding broadcasting.
- #730 `CClassifierPyTorch` has been modified to clean cached outputs and save memory when caching such data is not required.
- Internally optimized variables can be stored inside the attack class and fetched when needed.
- Accurate evaluation of objective function for some cleverhans attacks (CW, Elastic Net).
- #666 Model zoo downloader `ml.model_zoo.load_model` function will now try to download the version of a requested model corresponding to the version of secml. If not found, the latest 'master' version of the model will be downloaded instead.

### Changed (3 changes)
- #664 When passing pre-trained models to `CClassifierDNN` and subclasses the new `pretrained` parameter should now be set to `True`. Optionally, an array of classes on which the model has been pre-trained can be passed via the new `pretrained_classes` parameter. If `pretrained_classes` is left `None`, the number of classes will be inferred from the size of the last DNN layer as before.
- `CConstraintL2.project(x)` projects now `x` onto a hypersphere of radius `radius-tol`, with `tol=1e-6`. This conservative projection ensures that `x` is projected always inside the hypersphere, overcoming projection violations due to numerical rounding errors.
- `CModule.gradient` is not calling `forward` anymore, but only prepares data for `backward`. The forward step is not required, indeed, for modules that implement analytical gradients rather than autodiff.

### Fixed (10 changes)
- #677 Fixed `CClassifierPyTorch.get_state` crashing when optimizer is not defined.
- #134 Fixed passage of `n_jobs` parameter to `CDataLoaderPyTorch` in `CClassifierPyTorch` where 2 processes are being used by the loader even if `n_jobs` is set to 1. The default value for parameter `num_workers` in `CDataLoaderPyTorch` is now correctly 0.
- #749 Fixed `CArray.argmin` and `.argmax` returning float types when applied to sparse arrays of float dtype.

- #710 Random seed in `CClassifierPyTorch` is now correctly applied also when running on the CuDNN backend.
- #639: Objective function parameter (`objective_function`) in `CAttackEvasionCleverhans` is now correctly populated for `ElasticNetMethod` and `SPSA` attacks.

### Removed & Deprecated (5 changes)
- #748 `CNormalizerUnitNorm.inverse_transform` has been removed (it only worked if one inverted `x` after transforming it, but not if other transforms were applied in between).
- Removed the parameters `n_feats` and `n_classes` from the interface of `CAttackEvasionCleverhans`.
- #744 Deprecate kernel parameter from `CClassifierSGD` and `CClassifierRidge` and removed deprecated parameter `kernel='linear'` from notebook `01-Training.ipynb`.
